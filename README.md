## How I designed and created my website
Responsiveness is vital for modern web design. The increase of web traffic in modernity is heavily due to the use of mobile phones and tablets. Therefore a professional website must account for usability on any screen sizes. I therefore included media queries for checking and accounting for various screen sizes, and adjusted the websiteâ€™s grid display accordingly. Some examples of where media queries were used for the web portfolio, is checking for mobile/reduce screen sizes, so that the website may dynamically readjust multi columns grids into a single column grid.

## Difficulties and Lessions learnt

However I learnt difficulties with mobile support can be more technical, and complicated than simply UI/UX designs. On mobile browsers there is a lack of support for animated svg files, and therefore the background may not load on some devices. This issue can often be unexpected until the final deployment of the website on mobile phones.

## My solution to the issue addressed

The solution for the lack of animated backgrounds on mobile browsers aims to bring animations to the mobile web application, as seen in the desktop versions. 
Otherwise currently a static background will be in place while a complete and fully integrated solution is being developed.

## Future Developments
Further revisions for the website are in place. Some features include sorting by skills, and an overall redesign.

Another possibilty is to recreate this application with React, as to demonstrated my abilities and showcase more features that I am capable of.
